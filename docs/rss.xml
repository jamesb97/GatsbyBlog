These clocks operated using a spring leveler system designated to the turning motion of the spring that changes every-time a full 360 clockwise rotation is accomplished on a circular object. Over time, as more resources become available for use in developing a smarter device, the mechanical clock came to play. This is, to this day, one of the oldest functioning watches which include pocket watches, and wristwatches. Mechanical clocks apply the usage of winding a mainspring that turns gears by moving each hand from a rotating balanced wheel. Then came along the electric or digital watch face, where small micro-led lights dilapidated onto a screen that showed the current time, adjusted using a small knob on the side of the main watch head. Over time, more notably, several smartwatch prototypes appeared that included a compact calculator, a heart rate monitor with GPS capabilities, and more. One of the earliest smartwatch designs came with a small led screen powered by solar energy, that was able to display messages when a user syncs their watch with their mobile devices in 1997. In the mid 2000’s, as technology became widely adopted, developers started writing code for smartwatch applications with the adaptation of Android WearOS and Apple OS. Popular applications including calendar, stopwatch, gallery, messages, and more started to appear on many smartwatches. Even popular watch companies including Rolex and Seiko have started working on their own smartwatch prototype. Seiko, the once popular watch company that launched in Japan, integrated a small TV onto their watch faces to attract customers by attaching a small adapter that is able to display information onto a screen. That unfortunately was not the best user experience people looked into as its technology was being developed by applying quartz chronograph. Even Samsung popularized their own version of the Android WearOS within their galaxy gear devices. Most noticeably, Apple has taken the smartwatch industry onto another level. They made their watches perform much better and more battery efficient compared to its predecessors. Owning an Apple Watch is like owning a current day Tesla. Each user that owns an Apple Watch is able to sync their personal profile between their other Apple owned devices providing seamless connectivity under the Apple ecosystem. No other company on the market so far has tried to provide a better user interface and user experience than that of Apple. What makes it more appealing than other popular smartwatch manufacturers. First and foremost, the brand is symbolic and appealing to customers, everyone expects it to give a form of recognition to the table. Second, most tech consumers would point out the apple ecosystem and how strong it is getting each year in attracting more customers. Their applications are flawless, interface is clean and the battery performance is superior when it comes to owning a smartwatch. Apple’s lineup accounts for 23.4% of the total smartphone sales across the globe, making it a true champion when paired with its predecessor the Apple Watch. Apple is currently in the lead for best smartwatch price and performance, most importantly it offers a sleek and clean user interface and watch design. One of the few reasons Android users have noted their smartwatch lacks app compatibility and frequent sync issues compared to Apple. There have been moments when the watch would lose connectivity when it is a few inches away from its source, and pairing a pair of headphones is a hassle. Android WearOS applications don’t have great benchmark scores. Over time, Android smartwatches might be able to finally fix major bug issues in their software as more developers aim at producing cleaner and efficient product applications offered on hundreds of Android WearOS devices. Only time will tell what the next smartwatch prototype will be, and whether or not a company unlike Apple or Samsung will become more noticeable in the smartwatch industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Autonomous Vehicles]]></title><description><![CDATA[Autonomous Vehicles are certain types of vehicles that are capable of performing similar actions compared to humans in operating driverless…]]></description><link>https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/autonomous/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/autonomous/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Feb 2021 18:02:25 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous Vehicles are certain types of vehicles that are capable of performing similar actions compared to humans in operating driverless technology through the ability to sense it’s nearby surroundings. These vehicles are equipped with multiple sensors, lidar, and radar detection optimization, and scene optimization to name a few. Autonomous vehicles technology involves multiple key components when it comes to the proper interaction of an autonomous vehicle. The technology behind autonomous vehicles integration consists of sensors, connectivity, and software controlled algorithms that power the seamless autonomy. Each component plays a big role in allocating an automated vehicle that is able to successfully be on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of Autonomous Vehicles include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tesla Model S&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cadillac CT6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mercedes-Benz S-Class&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BMW X7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Concept&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-driving cars, also referred to as autonomous cars or driverless cars, obtains visual information from a series of cameras and sensors, converts it to grayscale, and applies semantic segmentation using AI technology. This then gets the system to process any ongoing changes being interpreted during the driving simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6 different levels of autonomy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 0: A human driver has total control over all the operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 1: A function is automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 2: More than one function becomes automated, whether that is the steering wheel and acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 3: Conditional Automation, capable of performing some tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 4: High Automation, able to perform most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Level 5: Fully autonomous in which the vehicle is capable of self operating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To qualify as fully autonomous, a vehicle must be able to navigate without a human intervention to a predetermined destination over roads that have not been adapted for its use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Details&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers behind the autonomous self-driving technologies imply an ample quantity of data including image recognition systems, machine learning and neural networks in order to successfully design an autonomous self-driving experience. The neural networks are responsible for identifying the interpreted data collection patterns by implying machine learning gathered from the camera’s visual interpretation of it’s surrounding environment. Drive OS, offered by Nvidia, is an operating system designed for accelerated computing that offers multiple input sensors processing real-time AI inference. It is crucial in providing input information for autonomous vehicles. It consists of the sensor abstraction layer(SAL), vehicle I/O support and a deep neural network(DNN) framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenges/Concerns&lt;/b&gt;: In March 2018, Elaine Herzberg died after a self-driving Uber Volvo car failed to recognize the object from its camera sensors as a pedestrian in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What should be the next steps?&lt;/b&gt; More testing that yields better results in classifying each tertiary object within the camera’s sensor point-of-view. Fewer error prone logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Google’s self driving project(Waymo)&lt;/b&gt;: Waymo utilizes a mixture of sensors including Lidar and consolidates deep learning algorithms with Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lidar Technology&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concept&lt;/b&gt;: Lidar(Light detection and ranging) technology is one of the most popular remote sensing approaches when it comes to calculating an object’s exact distance located on Earth’s surface. Lidar implies a pulsed radar that is used to measure the object’s variable distance by emitting light pulses. These light pulses are capable of generating accurate 3D information from the Earth’s surface and its target object. There are three primary components when it comes to Lidar systems: the scanner, laser, and GPS receiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of Lidar Systems being used in production today include Airborne Lidar, and Terrestrial Lidar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fundamental&lt;/b&gt;: Shine a laser light onto a terrestrial object, and calculate the amount of time required to return its source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Formula&lt;/b&gt;: Distance of the object = (Speed of Light x Time of Flight) / 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developmental Aspirations&lt;/b&gt;: Oceanography, Digital Elevation or Terrain Model, Agriculture &amp;#x26; Archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidar technologies have been rapidly expanding in production, reaching an all time high for consumer demands since 2016 and beyond. Fully autonomous vehicles are expected to hit the market as early as 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steps needed to obtain a fully autonomous projection system&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sense: Gather environment information from sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perceive: Filter, interpret &amp;#x26; understand sensor data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decide: Safely choose actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actuate: Initiate actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenges&lt;/b&gt;: The price for autonomous vehicle protection is relatively expensive. The increase of sensor proximity and real-time detection is becoming more challenging with newer innovations and time optimization. Increase in software complexity. Enlightened in-car passenger exposures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is expected that by the end of 2020, automaker manufacturers will deploy multiple vehicles with integrated semi-fully autonomous features. And by the year 2035, it is expected that most cars will be able to gain full autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Segmentation]]></title><description><![CDATA[A brain tumor is the occurence in which a vast number of abnormal cells grow inside the brain.

Moreover,
there is an abounding number of existing brain tumors some of which can be classified as noncancerous(benign), and others
as cancerous(malignant). Consequently, brain tumors start from the brain, or other parts of the body to which can
eventually lead up to the brain. This process can be referred to as secondary brain tumors. One of the most common primary
brain malignancies is gliomas. Moreover, “glioma therapy is a combination of surgery, chemo - and radiotherapy.” Nonetheless,
when it comes to brain tumor segmentation, the process might seem fairly complicated on the outside, whereas it can be accomplished
using the proper tools. Such tools include handheld technologies such as Raman Spectroscopic Probes, 5-ALA Fluroscence Visualization
and Raman Spectroscopy. In fact, Dr. Sofie Van Cauter stated in her article, “when dealing with a brain tumor, radiologists look
at multiple MRI sequences performed in multimodal imaging protocol.” After all, brain tumor segmentation is the process of separating
the tumor from normal brain tissues. Nevertheless, this process is challenging given that the brain is in an irregular form of state and
confusing boundaries of tumors. On the other hand, recently there has been a massive growth in the use of deep convolutional neural
networks (DCNN) to which each test produced an adequate result in natural and medical imaging segmentation tasks. Without
a doubt, there was a slight concern, one in which the models are difficult to obtain from a large dataset. Similarly, Magnetic
Resonance Imaging(MRI) has been commonly used in the clinical routine. This can be the fact that it can overture high spatial resolution
images with high constrast amidst soft tissues. The challenges that can arise from brain tumor segmentation can be scaled down with the
use of AI technologies by developing an algorithm for determining a faster brain tumor subtype accuracy. In general, an “accurate
segmentation of brain tumors from MRI images represents a crucial and a challenging task in diagnosis and treatment planning.”
Currently, image segmentation is a growing terrain when it comes to medical imaging, as it abides with the abstraction in images from the
evolving era of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Current Situation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most common treatments for brain tumor segmentation is surgery. This process employs the slowness of tumor growth to make
the segmentation procedure doable. However, with the process of localizing the diameter of each tumor in the brain can become difficult
to quickly, and one step to overcome this challenge is to utilize MRI scanning, which can be beneficial in providing detailed scans of
the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, image scanning can produce both low and high grade outputs in classifying the segmented areas. In other words, “spectroscopic
tools have the theoretical advantage of accurate tissue identification, coupled with the potential for manual intraoperative adjustments
to improve visualization of remaining tumor tissue that would otherwise be difficult to detect.” Moreover, there still consists a major
challenge in determining accurate segmentation when performing image abstraction that can successfully treat each patient. As Sajid Iqbal stated
in his research, “There may exist multiple tumors of different types in a human brain at the same time.” Each stochastic model can produce complex
presence when extracting from the tumor’s texture and can result in a geographical changeable component that may differ from the actual output.
The following figure shows the results of several MRI segmentation image scans using HGG and LGG cohort cases when inspecting each individual
brain in classifying a tumor patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, scientists and researchers have discovered an architect for treating brain tumor by using machine learning techniques such as deep
learning and CNN efficiency. The use of AI technologies can further improve the overall process needed to accurately segment brain tumors by
applying segmentation algorithms which can reduce several challenges in diagnosis accuracy and speed performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate, CNNs are willing to facilitate the copied MRI image scan and perform the burden of tumor segmentation. Second, the overall
procedure comprises network training and using a hand operated segmented database that is later stabilized in the final image output. Lastly,
the segmented images can be refined expeditiously to envision analytical sequelae including therapy &amp;#x26; survival feedback. The amount of data
obtained from regular MRI scanning is large and can take up to several hours to process. In other words, the use of Convolutional Neural Networks
can speed up processing time by applying automatic segmentation for each patient whether they persist HGG(Higher Grade Gliomas) or LGG(Lower Grade
Gliomas) tumors. Generally, patients with LGG tumors achieve higher accuracy during segmentation compared to those that contain HGG tumors. In
contrast, most of the segmentations are fulfilled by the use of a wrapper library in Keras and implemented with TensorFlow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;History&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure behind brain tumor segmentation dates to the development of CT and MRI scanners. On the contrary, CT(Computer Tomography) Scanners
appeared in the medical field in 1957 but was first initialized in 1971 on a patient’s brain. This process made image scanning more efficient
from the traditionalized manual labor. To illustrate, CT Scanners were able to process segmented data points in a patient’s brain at “forty 8 mm slices”
every 5 to ten seconds. Over time, this was able to achieve a 512 by 512 matrix image by scanning different parts of the brain within a matter of seconds.
To demonstrate, CT Scanners were able to successfully help determine a patient’s tumor and subtle delineation with detailed pixel verdict for identifying
the patient’s dilemma and how to resolve it. In contrast, MRI scanning came into play in 1977 when the first patient was successfully scanned for any possible
deterioration. This led to establishing a full-body MRI machine for undergoing multiple images scans at once. With the creation of AI and machine learning
protocols, in the early 1960’s, scientists and researchers have adopted multiple deep learning protocols that are geared towards helping perform
automatic segmentations on patients by reducing the processing time and execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be quite a challenge when performing brain tumor segmentations. With the help of AI and machine learning, CNNs can speed up the mechanism
for segmentation by reducing the estimated time required to render each scanned image produced by the MRI. The process of image scanning has
improved from using recursive sequences to dynamic programming implementation by magntitude structure, even when max-pooling layers are precise.
Furthermore, deep neural networks can transcend in analyzing images, detection and segmentation. Without a doubt, deep learning networks have
been shown to cultivate adequate procedures in processing medical imaging segmentation tasks. As each algorithm gets smarter by overcoming its
mistakes, the process of brain tumor segmentation will eventually present accurate diagnostic readings from overcoming slow stuttering and weak
performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blockchain Technology]]></title><description><![CDATA[Over the last decade, as more and more technological resources become publicly available, payment systems are still trying to catch up with…]]></description><link>https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/blockchain/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/blockchain/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2020 18:02:25 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, as more and more technological resources become publicly available, payment systems are still trying to catch up with other trends in the technology market, competing with one another. This is where blockchain comes in mind. Blockchain technology, still in its early stages, is changing the way payment systems are handled by sending electronic signals between multiple devices. Blockchain makes the history of any form of digital asset transparent by the adoption of decentralization and cryptographic hashing. Blockchain technology can be a revolutionary technology by helping reduce risks, stamp out fraud and bring transparency in a scaleable way for myriad uses. Blockchain subsits of three important concepts: blocks, nodes, and miners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blocks&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every chain subsits of several blocks, where each block has three basic elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data in the block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 32-bit whole number called a &lt;b&gt;nonce&lt;/b&gt;. The nonce is randomly generated after each block is created, and generates a block header hash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;b&gt;hash&lt;/b&gt; is a 256-bit number wedded to the nonce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the first block is created, a nonce generates the cryptographic hash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Miners&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miners conceive new blocks on the chain over a process called mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miners use a special software for solving the incredibly complex math problem from finding a nonce that generates an accepted hash. Making a change to any block earlier in the chain requires re-mining not just the block with the change, but all of the blocks afterwards. When a block has been profitably mined, the change is accepted by all of the nodes on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nodes&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important concept in blockchain technology is decentralization. No device or organization can own the chain. It is instead distributed via nodes, which are connected to the chain. Nodes are electronic devices that maintain copies of the blockchain for keeping the network functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every node has its own copy of the blockchain and the network accept any newly mined blocks for the chain to be updated, trusted and verified. Each participant is given a unique alphanumeric identification number that displays their transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How Blockchain Technology Works&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, the user requests a transaction in the system, which represents that the transaction is closed. Afterwards, the block is broadcasted to all of the nodes relucant on the network. All of the nodes validate each specified block &amp;#x26; transaction. Next, the block is added onto a chain, where other individuals recieves a form of payment. Final step, when the transaction gets verified, the user which requested the transaction receives their payment, and the transaction has been completed. Essentially, blockchains can be thought of as the scalability of trust via technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Future of Blockchain Technology&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more and more companies start to adopt cryptocurrency as one of their primary source of payment transactions, obtaining the resources for blockchain to operate has become more readily available. The government predicts that by the year 2030 most corporate companies will adopt or create any form of virtual currency. A few of the most valuable companies including Amazon, Alphabet(GOOG), and Microsoft are adopting changes to the payment methods for clients. The modern state economy is based on long transitions, towards an all digital business that fully relies on online connections. Blockchain technology adequately reduces each cost of transaction. This represents trillion-dollar firms being replaced by trillion-dollar tokens. It is still unlikely that by 2030, a solution to the current existing payment plans can resolve data and privacy concerns from the digital age era. Blockchain Technology has improved in speed and preformance thanks to the current infrastructure, making each connection more secure.&lt;/p&gt;

Virtual reality can be described as a simulated experience to which can be portrayed as entering another dimension, similarly to that of the real world. This can lead to exploring endless possibilities from interacting with implicit objects to real-life items, compared to a hologram. Some applications of virtual reality include entertainment and educational purposes. Consequently, augmented reality and extended reality are a few of the virtual reality experiences being developed to this day. Popular virtual reality headsets include Facebook Oculus Quest 2, Sony Playstation VR, and HTC Vive Cosmos. To demonstrate, certain organizations take this technology and imply it to real-world problems, for producing better results and customer satisfaction. In other words, companies adapt virtual reality alongside augmented reality for testing each developmental environment in production, before sending it out to the real world. This can ensure that each successful test, when passed without production problems, can then be implemented onto the real-world application before a product is widely available to the general public. Moreover, Pfinder, a real-time tracking system, has performed reliable tests on multiple people throughout different locations by using a multiclass statistical model of color and shape. Consequently, this system is capable of segmenting a person from a background scene, to which it then finds and tracks a person’s movements in a range of viewing conditions. On the other hand, researchers at Indiana University Bloomington, developed a way for face tracking capabilities in virtual reality for use in a perceptual user interface by applying computer vision. Their research implies that the CAMSHIFT algorithm is integrated into a computer interface for controlling commercial computer games and immersive 3D graphic worlds. A company in China is taking Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning components onto a new branch of virtual reality, called inverse virtual reality(IVR). This system has the capacity to subcontain the intelligence-driven virtual reality and the physical reality, adequately suitable for building an intelligence-driven mutually mirrored world. Below is a data screenshot of the current VR/AR Market Size in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, augmented reality can leverage the full space for an environment by the creation of immersive experiences. As certain objects tend to move far away from the field of view, the efficacy and usability from different interaction modalities are subject to change. Augmented reality is geared more towards users being able to interact with their surrounding environment by adopting technology capable of superimposing information, without necessarily being involved with computer generated environments as seen with virtual reality. Augmented reality can enhance each user’s senses with images, information and audio. Whereas, on the other hand, the primary focus for virtual reality is to generate an immersive experience to which users can interact with one another in a virtual environment identical to the outside surroundings. Virtual Reality can offer the enticing premise of a rich sensory experience. Virtual reality consists of three important premises: immersion, interaction, and imagination. In general, most people would like to experience changes occurring on the screen from their response signals being retrieved by the commands inputed within the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways virtual reality is making an impact is through the adoption of wearable technology, which aims in reducing a patient’s anxiety, stress and medical disorders in healthcare. Furthermore, medical imaging VR is geared towards providing better planning support in a patient’s safety by reducing their overall dose of radiation exposure. To demonstrate, within the cath lab, there is a paradigm shift underway on how a physician can interact with their environment. They can then use their knowledge in assisting each patient virtually through a virtual screen without necessarily looking at a computer monitor the whole period. This can allow each process to move faster, efficient, and more intuitive compared to the better well-known standardized way. Moreover, virtual reality can bring a completely new era of interactivity, experience with friends and family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Future of VR Technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual Reality is expected to grow by a 15.5 billion euro investment. In addition, companies will be able to transform their digital infrastructure plans into this area of technology which can exceed that of the consumer sector. Whereas, the demand for virtual reality technology is projected to skyrocket beyond leisure, tourism, and marketing, where there is user affordability. However, virtual interfaces should first be fixated in order to minimize side effects, which can include motion sickness, dizziness, etc.Businesses have been gaining traction into this hot field of technology, and will tap into opportunities it can present. Some of the big tech companies have started to develop virtual reality headsets capable of wireless connectivity for providing a better user experience including the removal of unnecessary cables and HD images. Some speculations have argued that Artificial Intelligence is expected to be integrated into all virtual reality headsets, and 5G connectivity. In addition, virtual, augmented and mixed reality is expected to be a $150 billion market by the year 2020. Below is a representation of American’s views on virtual reality devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see more and more people are starting to gain interest in owning a VR device. On the other hand, 2020 has become a major turning point where enterprises and organizations across all verticals are embracing the unarticulated need for augmented, mixed, and virtual reality. With an increase in stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many small and large enterprises are realizing that a new tactic must be placed for providing the same experiences accomplished at these locations. Here is a depiction of the latest top sector market share as of lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, virtual reality has become increasingly accessible with developments in technology, making headsets and software development more common to meet education and training needs. In contrast, virtual reality has a potential in conceiving immersive experiences by compelling people to believe in physical preset while being locked in a virtual space. Some common types of virtual reality implementations include non-immersive, semi-immersive and full-immersive scenes. With rising technologies, and major improvements in the user experience, virtual reality is expected to adapt into the field of science and technology, and lead us to advances that will shape our future. In conclusion, virtual reality is capable of conceding connectivities with more devices and larger user bases. In addition, it’s almost imperceptible latency will adjust the consumer’s output to obtain images in real time, just as they are witnessing them with their own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ASP.NET]]></title><description><![CDATA[ASP.NET is a type of web service that is used throghout the course of making web applications, and it can also be tied to the concept of…]]></description><link>https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/ASP.NET/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/ASP.NET/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2020 18:02:25 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;ASP.NET is a type of web service that is used throghout the course of making web applications, and it can also be tied to the concept of Object Oriented Programming. Object Oriented Programming is a type of software that allows users to build large based applications such as writing code in different languages. Some of these Object Oriented Programs include Java, Python, Ruby, C++ as well as C#, which is built based on this concept of ASP.NET. There are a couple of features that make ASP.NET stand out from the rest, and that is the ability of using web services. Some other based languages are limited to the ability of having the same bit of computerized information shared across multiple devices &amp;#x26; applications simultaneously causing the process to work so perfectly and even flawlessly. ASP.NET has the ability to manage this useful piece of advice that other similar markup languages still can’t seem to process. However, with every pro, comes a con, and ASP.NET is not the one to improvise when it comes to bandwidth limitations. ASP.NET or more C#, created and maintained by Microsoft, still requires an HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) in order to support viewing on all browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every user uses the same browser when they log into the world wide web. ASP.NET however manages to process all of the coding process similar to that of a normal application, and also making it a true crown winner when it comes to Object Oriented Programming to the Internet. Now what makes this program stand out from the crowd, is the ability to have complete compatibility with multiple languages into one mainframe, for example if a user is editing the application in the form of VB.NET interface and another user edits in C#, those two programs when combined, outputs the same results ASP.NET Markup Language would print. In more conclusional manner, ASP.NET is a great language to learn for someone looking to code more of a web based application and service adding details to a structured UI design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[CyberCrime]]></title><description><![CDATA[As technology advances onward with new inventions each month, the amount of revenue increases as well.

But as everyone today has at least one electronic device, it might be linked to several places and accounts that can omit a danger zone.When people use the internet to access data and web accounts, they are either sharing the same network at a public area or using the WiFi connection at home. Sharing accounts or accessing the same server can link users a greater chance to publish and sell information over the internet. The internet can lead to several pot holes which may include identity theft, computer security, internet fraud, downloading and cyberbullying. Identity Theft is currently one of the quickest growing crimes that appears over the internet. Computer security must always be updated to the latest version of anti-malware. Internet Fraud or also commonly referred to as networking fraud is a type of hack that enables users to gain access to another person’s account by utilizing information from the same network connection. Downloading programs can lead to a person agreeing to terms of use that will require them to share accounts in order to download music, games, etc. With an increase in technology, security should be one of the key priorities when it comes to attacks from identity theft, downloading, cyberbullying, internet frauds and computer safety today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most dangerous types of crimes that can occur online prior to cybercrime is identity theft. Identity theft occurs when a criminal steals data from another users account by hacking personal information from one account to the other on the same network connection. Prior to doing that, the hacker will get access to personal records that include credit card scores, social security numbers, etc. The enormous growth of Internet technology has made various resources on the Web instantly accessible to users. Now that the hacker has full authority to publish private information to the public if no one takes action against him. The criminal also has an advantage of using other persons account for opening up social security numbers, credit card accounts and even bank accounts. Technology, mainly the internet, facilitates more harming schemes that in many cases may result in financial losses and in some cases the victims of identity may experience difficulty obtaining credit or restoring their name. With identity theft, users can lose all of their data stored if they don’t take the right security measures when it comes to a breach in the network servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important role when it comes to security is the safety of computers and their settings. Security is a big deal when it comes to computers. Always have an antivirus or antimalware program installed with the latest version updated. The bad guys constantly develop new ways to attack your computer, so your security software must be up-to-date to protect against the latest threats. Run scans on daily use to remove malware, and retain hackers from accessing the firewall. Never purchase security software that will contain pop ups which can ask for emails and scams that can lead to a hacker asking for private information. Scanners send messages like these to try to get you to buy worthless software or worse to break and enter your computer. Never give out information to strangers. They will use that information, like social security number, credit cards, ids, etc. and sell it to the public for good fortune. Hackers will also wipe out all of the information after receiving it from the users private information. Users should always have their firewall turned on and to never allow access from an unknown source. An unknown source can have dangerous items that can cause users to lose access to folders and other databases important to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users should also be aware if a breach in the internet occurs. This means that there is a possibility that a hacker might be entering codes, information from his computer using the users router and location. Federal Law defines computer fraud as the use of a computer to create dishonest misrepresentation of fact as an attempt to induce another to do so or refrain from doing something which causes loss. Once the hacker has received the information from the user, he can then send software codes straight into the bank, which will then identify the suspect who is presented in the pictures. Researchers have developed a new type of act that will help eliminate the spread of frauds over internet servers that can lead to serious bank account controls and the use of private social security numbers. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act(CFAA) prohibits intentionally accessing a computer without authorization, but fails to define what without authorization means. With this act approved, the percentage of users hacking into another account would be lowered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another case closely relatable to causes of cybercrime would be cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place using electronic technology. Many teenagers and adults have grown a habit where they would use mobile phones, computers and other electronic devices to contact each other. Whether it would be through social media or cell phones, sometimes a situation between two people might get serious and offending. Cyberbullying can include: posting a bad, uncomfortable picture on social media, setting up a fake profile picture or recieve mean and arrogant text messages from one another. Cyberbullying can also lead to selling and posting pictures and statistics over the internet that can cause a persons information to spread worldwide with millions accessing it. Kids who are cyberbullied are more likely to use alcohol and drugs, skip school, receive poor grades and have a lower self-esteem. The use of communication devices or the internet to verbally abuse or threaten another individual was in a persons life when it is not taken seriously. Cyberbullying will occur every day twenty four seven and has the benefits of reaching children when they are alone. Messages and pictures that get sent unidentified are harder to track down who the messenger is. Deleting unsuitable context from social media, text messages and pictures can be much harder than deleting it from personal library. An image or text that has been published to social media websites will remain permanent even after it gets deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology requires a good amount of protection in order for crimes not to be shown. Technology is mankinds best friend and will need backup if danger ever shows up. A breach in the computer system can lead to stolen information and identity that will result in identity theft, cyberbullying, computer fraud, and security fissures. With a measurable amount of security risks, humans can protect their electronic devices from unwanted items by installing the latest antimalware program on their computers or any other device. Security is an important step towards protecting account information, passwords, credit cards and bank account statements. Take measurable caution or hackers will wipe out information that can never be seen again. As years go by, more and more people will start to rely on their mobile devices. They will be using them to: contact one another, send files, complete tasks, watch movies, etc. However, the risk of hacking will increase due to a larger sharing network and easier access. Mankind should not let anyone control their private information and definitely not let anyone gain access to it to share it via internet. Whatever gets posted online will be permanently stored and will not be deleted even after seleting the delete option.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[IoT Devices]]></title><description><![CDATA[As more and more connected devices are being produced on a daily basis, the rise of smart devices are being readily available in the hands…]]></description><link>https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/iot/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://gatsbystarterblogsource.gatsbyjs.io/iot/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Nov 2020 18:02:25 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As more and more connected devices are being produced on a daily basis, the rise of smart devices are being readily available in the hands of consumers and business alike. Some of these devices have grown into remote access, being accessible worldwide as more of each component becomes portable, requiring less space for carrying. IoT(Internet of Things) is a new terminology that is being used in the field of software technology which requires the knowledge of sensors, and software technology in order to operate successfully. It can also be described as a network of physical objects that can include real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. One of the earliest forms of inter connected devices dates back to the 19th century, where these so called IoT devices where tested in prescribing measurements gathered from weather data and wildlife preservations, alongside radio waves and satellite communications. IoT is a digitalized system, which includes interconnected devices, objects, and smart controls aimed at providing a smarter environment. This does not need human supervision as it can provide unique identifiers and the ability to transmit data over a shared network. The proper mechanism to connect and assemble digital electronics ensures that the user receives a network connection amongst parsing a fractional subdomain portion that comprises of several encrypted and decrypted tokens inter-communicating between each other. There subsists a clear visual interface between the real and digitized world to which separates each communicated device. Alongside the hardware and the software of each device, there must be a mean of exchange occurring between each transmissible device. This layer might be referred to as the communication mechanism, where each single device is tied to the software and hardware aspect vitality. Once the hardware, software and communication protocol is substantiated, an IoT platform detriments a proper location for carefully processing data, managing states, analyzing solutions and problem-solving in a so-called IoT device management environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
